Run 2: 

Team 1 Volatile 1:
  * Volatile found at 101 localized at 139
  * Excavator parks at 176
  * Finds volatile at 186
  * Hauler Parks at 368
  * Excavation at 378. [20 Volatiles in Hauler] (5-5-5-5)
  * Hauler Undocks at 507
  * Reaches Hopper at 706 [19 volatiles in hauler]
  * All volatiles deposited scoring 13 points (ICE)

Team 1 Volatile 2:
  * Excavator proceeds at 512
  * Excavator parks at 579
  * Finds volatile at 798 (confirmation of the digging site)
  * Hauler fails to find excavator at 862
  * Excavator Visual resets at 896
  * After that, no longer able to find the volatile... (974)

Team 1 Volatile 3:
  * Excavator proceeds at 979
  * Excavator visual reset at 1087
  * Parks excavator at 1172
  * Hauler parks at 1510
  * Hauler Undocks at 1735 [20 points in hauler] (3-3-3-3-3-2-3)
  * Hauler reaches processing plant at 1822 [13 points in hauler]
  * Got stuck in Parking To Hopper.......



Team 2 Volatile 1:
  * Scout found volatile at 214
  * Localized at 241
  * Excavator got lost and Scout could not do visual reset at 593
  * Excavator never reached the scout.
  * Excavator keeps trying to get to the location for the rest of the simulation


Comments:
  * When the scout failed and excavator succeeded in visual reset, excavator got stuck in a visual reset loop. Excavator only kept on resetting its odometry for the rest of the simulation. Need to debug and see if this was a bug in the code
